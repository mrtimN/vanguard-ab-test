# Vanguard A/B Testing

## Project Overview
This project evaluates Vanguard’s website redesign through A/B testing, measuring its impact on user experience and completion rates.

## Data & Methods
- **Data Sources**: User interactions, demographics, and experiment assignments.
- **Processing**: Cleaning, merging datasets, and handling missing values.
- **Analysis**: Completion rates, error rates, and time spent per step.

## Key Findings
- **Completion Rate**: Increased by **8%** in the test group.
- **Error Rate**: Test group saw a **3% rise**, indicating usability concerns.
- **Time Spent**: No significant difference between designs.

## Experiment Design
- **Duration**: March–June 2017 (~3 months).
- **Randomization**: Balanced across age and gender.
- **Limitations**: Possible external factors and device/browser effects.

## Recommendations
- Improve error handling with real-time prompts.
- Gather user feedback for additional refinements.

## Conclusion
The new UI **enhances completion rates** but slightly increases errors. The benefits outweigh the downsides, making it a **viable improvement**.
